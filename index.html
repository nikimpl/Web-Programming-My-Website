                    &emsp;Every day, the evolution of technology brings us one step closer to real-life problems’ solutions. 
                    Inarguably, the most important challenges that we need to face are ones regarding our own health. 
                    Since the dawn of time, technology has been of crucial help to us and the systems we have developed have saved countless lives. 
                    But since evolution is restless, there is a new technology in the works that can completely reshape medical 
                    practice as we know it and it has to do with the nowadays booming field of artificial intelligence.<br> 

                    &emsp;Imagine an algorithm that can utilize many years’ worth of clinical records and medical expertise in order to 
                    give the best and most accurate diagnosis even in the most difficult cases. Taking into account the incredible 
                    technological advances that are being made every day, this does not seem too far-fetched and it could very well 
                    be the new normal in the near future.<br>

                    &emsp;If we wish to have a better understanding of what’s to come, we must first know about what exactly makes an algorithm
                    intelligent and if it could really aid – or even replace – a doctor’s diagnosis.<br><br>

                    &emsp;AI algorithms need training almost exactly like humans do; just like doctors go through medical schooling, take exams, 
                    receive grades and learn from their mistakes, AI algorithms also undergo a similar process and finally learn how to 
                    perform their assigned task correctly and efficiently – sometimes even outperforming their human counterparts.</p>

                    <p>&emsp;The first step in generating an effective AI algorithm is to gather structured data and “feed” them into the algorithm. 
                    Once the algorithm has been exposed to enough sets of data, the programmers will analyze its results and measure its accuracy 
                    – just like a professor would mark a student’s exam. The reason the programmers can calculate the exact accuracy rate is 
                    because they already know the correct answers to the data they used as an input. This type of data is called “test data” 
                    and it is always used in the first phase of the algorithm’s development. Based on how well or how bad the algorithm’s testing 
                    results will be, it will then be modified, fed more data, or rolled out to help make decisions for the person who wrote the algorithm.<br>

                    &emsp;In the field of medicine, most AI applications read in either numerical (such as heart rate or blood pressure) or image-based 
                    data (such as MRI scans or Images of Biopsy Tissue Samples) as an input. The algorithms then learn from the data and give back 
                    either a probability or a classification as a result. For instance, the result could be the probability of having an arterial 
                    clot given heart rate and blood pressure data, or the labeling of an imaged tissue sample as cancerous or non-cancerous. 
                    It is safe to say that if these types were to be fully integrated into day-to-day medical practice, the future of healthcare would 
                    drastically change.<br><br>

                    &emsp;Two recent AI applications of accurate and clinically relevant algorithms that help doctors in the process of making a diagnosis are
