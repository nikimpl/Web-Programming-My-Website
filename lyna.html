                    <p>&emsp;In the fall of 2018, researchers at Google AI Healthcare created a learning algorithm, 
                    <mark>LYNA (Lymph Node Assistant)</mark>, that analyzed histology slides stained tissue samples) to identify 
                    metastatic breast cancer tumors from lymph node biopsies. This is not the first application of AI 
                    to attempt histology analysis, but interestingly this algorithm could identify suspicious regions 
                    undistinguishable to the human eye in the biopsy samples given. LYNA was tested on two datasets 
                    and was shown to accurately classify a sample as cancerous or noncancerous correctly 99% of the time. 
                    Furthermore, when given to doctors to use in conjunction with their typical analysis of stained tissue samples, 
                    LYNA halved the average slide review time. This suggests the intriguing potential for assistive technologies 
                    such as LYNA to reduce the burden of repetitive identification tasks and to allow more time and energy for 
                    pathologists to focus on other, more challenging clinical and diagnostic tasks. Encouragingly, pathologists 
                    with LYNA assistance were more accurate than either unassisted pathologists or the LYNA algorithm itself, 
                    suggesting that people and algorithms can work together effectively to perform better than either alone.<br>
